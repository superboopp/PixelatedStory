# üì´ - How to use

> To use this template, you can download it from the releases, since they are bug approved and fixed versions! After downloading, extract the zip file to a folder and modify the whole body [HTML] for what you need. If you want more advanced features and don't have the knowledge, I recommend hiring a developer to do it for you.

# üîí - API

> To add the checkout system with payment methods you can use the cookies that are created when the user logs in to generate payment APIs. Here is what cookies are and how you can get them using JavaScript:

```js
const loggedCookie = getCookieValue('logged');
console.log(loggedCookie);

const userCookie = getCookieValue('nickname');
console.log(userCokkie);

```

# üéØ - Considerations

> The project has a preview of a login and registration system. This system was all done with JS, as mentioned before, only as a preview. It is necessary to adapt or remove it to use in your project because it was added since it was mandatory in the college project. The Checkout system **WAS NOT** added for obvious reasons.
